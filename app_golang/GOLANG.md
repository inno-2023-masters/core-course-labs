# Best Practices

### Minimalism
Tried to keep the code as short as possible to avoid any unnecessary code. and any complixity that might lead to errors.
### Error Handling
I handle errors properly by checking the error returned by time.LoadLocation and using http.Error to respond with an error message and status code.
### Testing
Wrote a test for the handler function to make sure it returns the correct status code and the correct response body.
### Convention and Structure
Followed conventional naming for a go project. And followed Go's standard HTTP server patter in the HTTP Handler
### Comments
Wrote comments to explain the code and what it does.
### README
Created a README.md file to explain the project and how to run it.
